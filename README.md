# ðŸš¢ Task 2 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | AI & ML Internship

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Titanic dataset** to understand the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source:** [Titanic Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â€“ for static visualizations
- **Plotly** â€“ for interactive visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ for analysis

---

## ðŸ“Š Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Initial Inspection**
   - Loaded the dataset
   - Checked data types, dimensions, and first few rows

2. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Calculated mean, median, standard deviation, and counts for numeric & categorical features

3. **Missing Values Analysis**
   - Identified columns with missing data

4. **Data Visualization**
   - **Histograms** â€“ to check distribution of numeric features
   - **Boxplots** â€“ to detect outliers
   - **Correlation Heatmap** â€“ to understand relationships between numeric variables
   - **Pairplot** â€“ to visualize feature relationships
   - **Barplots** â€“ to compare survival rates by gender and class
   - **Interactive Scatter Plot** â€“ (Age vs Fare) with survival coloring

5. **Pattern & Insight Extraction**
   - Derived observations from the plots and statistics

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- **Females** had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- **First-class passengers** had better survival chances than other classes.
- There are **Fare outliers** (very high ticket prices).
- Younger passengers had slightly better survival chances.
